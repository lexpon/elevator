# Coding Challenge

Elevator control system for the company Wonderland.

## Problem Specification

Design and implement an elevator control system for the company Wonderland.
What data structures, interfaces and algorithms will you need?
Your elevator control system should be able to handle multiple elevators up to 16.

You can use the language of your choice to implement an elevator control system.
In the end, your control system should provide an interface for:

- Querying the state of the elevators (what floor are they on and where they are going)
- Receiving an update about the status of an elevator
- Receiving a pickup request

Time-stepping the simulation should be possible.

## Assessment Criteria

We expect that your code is well-factored, without needless
duplication, follow good practices and be automatically verified.

What we will look at:
- How clean is your design and implementation, how easy it is to
understand and maintain your code
- How you verified your software, if by automated tests or some
other way
